The only IOS App, that captures RAW timelapses.

RawLapse is very early in development.

Eventhough Raw photo capability has been there since Ios 10, none of the popular timelapse apps have added a raw timelapse option.

There are good apps for raw photos and for timelapses(apple stock camera being one of them). This app does not aim to compete with any of them. It is actually targeted for professional photographers, who are used to taking photos on their cameras. It by design requires post-processing but benefits from a highly increased flexibility at post-production.

The main features of the app are:
- Selecting a time interval and amount of photos to be taken(can be set to infinite)
- Tap to focus and exposure
- Lock focus and exposure
- Slide to adjust exposure compensation
- Lower shutter speeds support for far better low light.
- It displays current photo settings & amount of photos taken and to be taken.
- Auto screen diming while recording a timelapse(and quick preview using the proximity sensor)
- It saves all the photos as .dng to the photo library. This allows very quick and practical photo transfer with the iCloud Photo Library
- Auto converts your raw files in device and creates a timelapse out of them. (much better then standard jpeg processing , but might have an impact on battery life)

The main advantages of RawLapse over other timelapse apps are:

- Far better dynamic range(highlight shadow detail retention) thanks to the raw format
- Richer Colors
- No compression artifacts
- Much more control over the white balance of the image (and all the other benefits&flexibilities that comes with a raw photo)
- Noticeably better low light performance. (RawLapse makes sure the shutter speed is at 1/3(the minimum provided by the API) before increasing the ISO


I am open the new ideas, please make a request if you have one.
